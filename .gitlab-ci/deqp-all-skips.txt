# Note: skips lists for CI are just a list of lines that, when
# non-zero-length and not starting with '#', will regex match to
# delete lines from the test list.  Be careful.

# These are tremendously slow (pushing toward a minute), and aren't
# reliable to be run in parallel with other tests due to CPU-side timing.
